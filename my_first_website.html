                        Born in 1992 and hailing from The Bronx, New York, Cardi B first got the world's attention through social media with her tough and frank attitude about life as a stripper. Starting in 2015 she appeared on VH1's reality show Love & Hip Hop: New York and left the show in 2017 to pursue music full time. That same year she released her No. 1 single "Bodak Yellow" through Atlantic Records, and she followed with her debut album in April 2018. Her personal life also made headlines when she and Migos group member Offset became engaged in October 2017.
